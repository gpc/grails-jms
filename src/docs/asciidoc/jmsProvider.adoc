The plugin does not include a JMS provider so you must install and configure your own.

All you need to provide is one or more http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/jms/ConnectionFactory.html[javax.jms.ConnectionFactory] beans and the plugin takes care of the rest.

The plugin looks for a connection factory bean named `jmsConnectionFactory`.

The default SpringBoot configuration has caching enabled, which results in a bean named `cachingJmsConnectionFactory` being defined rather than `jmsConnectionFactory`.

To turn caching off, set the configuration property `spring.jms.cache.enabled` in `application.yml` like so.

[source,groovy]
----
spring:
    jms:
        cache:
            enabled: false
----

With caching disabled, there will be a `jmsConnectionFactory` bean defined.

If you wish to use this plugin with caching enabled, you can add the following line in `resources.groovy` to use a spring bean alias.

[source,groovy]
----
beans = {

    // ...
    springConfig.addAlias('jmsConnectionFactory', 'cachingJmsConnectionFactory')
}
