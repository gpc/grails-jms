== Plugging in a JMS Provider

The plugin does not include a JMS provider so you must install and configure your own.

All you need to provide is one or more {connection_factory}[javax.jms.ConnectionFactory] beans and the plugin takes care of the rest.

By default, the plugin looks for a connection factory bean named `jmsConnectionFactory` but this is configurable.
